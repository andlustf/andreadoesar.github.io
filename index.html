                <h1>Augmented Reality Simon Says</h1>
                <h3>App Description</h3>
                <p>For my midterm project, I have decided to take the classic game of Simon Says and turn it into Augmented Reality. The idea is, you'll be able to play a fun and interactive game, while stimulating your brain, and because it is in AR, you will be able to play it as long as you have access to the technology, no need for external devices that occupy a lot of space.</p>
                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>User initiates the application</li>
                    <li>User shows the marker to initiate AR application</li>
                    <li>User then presses start button to begin the game</li>
                    <li>User follows along the game as the game progresses</li>
                </ol>
