                <p>For my midterm project, I have decided to take the classic game of Simon Says and turn it into Augmented Reality. The idea is, you'll be able to play a fun and interactive game, while stimulating your brain, and because it is in AR, you will be able to play it as long as you have access to the technology, no need for external devices that occupy a lot of space.</p>
